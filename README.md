# 3D-Matrix Flatten Program

## Description
Java program to convert 3D-matrix of user-defined dimensions as n x m x p to 1D array using simple mapping function

## Procedures
1. User must define the dimensions of the matrix, default values are n= 3,m =2, p =5 but it can be modifed 
2. generate random integers 3D matrix but with some modification the program can run more datatypes generic
3. Print the generated Matix to compare the output results from the mapping operation
4. Allocating new array to store the mapped indices and apply the mapping operation
5. Reconstruct the initial matrix from the array and compare the results
6. User can define also indices for test cases as shown at the bottom of the code in main
7. Then user can enter from the command window simple spaced 3D index to access the matrix and the array an comapre the results till the user decide to terminate the program

## Files
The program consists of only two files where one for main method and test cases and another one for the logic operation, all the program tested in terimanl and no user interface is used

## Note
No additional library has been used just only java.util for Random function generation and Scanner for user input for testing.
